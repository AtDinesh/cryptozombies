# Chainlink: Decentralized Oracles

Blockchain Oracles are devices that connect our smart contracts and zombies with data and computation from the real world, such as pricing data on currencies, random number generators, and any other data we can think of. Blockchains can't interact with the outside world, as they are intentionally isolated and deterministic by nature. When your smart contracts include data or computation from oracles, they are considered hybrid smart contracts.
