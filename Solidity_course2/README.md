# Advanced Solidity: Get in-depth Knowledge

This course is separated into 5 parts:
- Deplopying DApps with Truffle
  - Also lean how to deploy smart contracts on *Loom*, which is a better fit for something like a game or a user-facing DApp.
- Testing Smart Contracts with Truffle
  - Test your smart contract with Truffle against Ganache
  - Use **Chai** to write more expressive assertions
  - Test against Loom
- How to Build an Oracle
  - How to build and interact with the simplest possible oracle that allows only one user (owner) to fetch data fro√πm Binance's public API.
- How to Build an Oracle - part 2
  - Implement the javascript components of the oracle
  - Write a simple Node.js client that interacts with the oracle. To keep things simple, you won't be building a fully-fledged web interface, but the code you'll write in this lesson will help you understand all the key aspects.
  - how to deploy the smart contracts and run the oracle.
- How to build an oracle - part 3
  - How to make the oracle more decentralized ?
